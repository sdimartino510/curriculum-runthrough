# üèóÔ∏è Implement and Use Modules

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to write and implement my own modules that have their own properties and methods.

* As a developer, I want to learn how to import those modules using Node.js.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created two files, `index.js` and `maths.js`.

* It's done when I have imported `maths.js` into `index.js`.

* It's done when I have written four methods for the results of the four basic mathematical operations in `maths.js` (`sum()`, `difference()`, `product()`, and `quotient()`).

* It's done when I have created variables to capture the values passed from the command line: `operation`, `numOne` and `numTwo`.

* It's done when I have written a `switch` statement that accepts an `operation` parameter.

* It'd done when each `case` of the `switch` statement uses the corresponding `maths` methods to perform each math operation on the numbers.

## üí° Hints

What will the `parseInt()` method allow us to do?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can you export functions and objects directly?
