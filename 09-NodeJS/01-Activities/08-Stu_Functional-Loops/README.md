# 🏗️ Implement Functional Loops

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to implement `map()` and `filter()` to solve problems instead of using a `for` loop.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have opened the `filter.js` file, mapped through `originalArray`, and created a new array containing only its prime numbers using `filter()`.

* It's done when I have used `filter()` to return an array containing only its numbers larger than five.

* It's done when I have opened `map.js` and used `map()` to map through `originalArray` and set the result equal to a new `tripledArray` array.

* It's done when I have mapped through the `originalArray` and returned a new array with the results `odd` or `even`.

## 💡 Hints

How can you use the term **immutable data** in a definition of `map()` and `filter()`?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can we implement arrow functions as callbacks in this activity?
