# 🏗️ Implement and Use `fs.appendFile()`

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to add to a file without overwriting the existing content.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created a `index.js` file that accepts a command-line argument.

* It's done when the program takes the input from the user and *appends* it to the file.

* It's done after I have run the program, passed in some text, and confirmed that it appended the text to `log.txt`.

## 💡 Hints

Going by naming convention alone, if `fs.readFile` reads a file and `fs.writeFile` writes to a file, what do you think the method for appending is?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can you add text from additional arguments on a new line?
