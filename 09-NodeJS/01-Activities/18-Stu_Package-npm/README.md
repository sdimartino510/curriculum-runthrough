# 🏗️ Initialize Projects using Node Package Manager (npm)

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to keep track of dependencies using `npm`. 

* As a developer, I want to be able to save packages to my project using `npm install`.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have navigated to `/init` in the terminal and ran `npm init`.

* It's done when I have responded to all the prompts regarding my project.

* It's done when I have confirmed that I have a `package.json` in the `/init` folder.

* It's done after I have installed `inquirer` in the `/init` folder by running `npm i inquirer --save`.

* It's done when I have navigated to `/package` in the terminal and ran `npm i`.

## 💡 Hints

How does the `-y` save us some time when running `npm init`? What does the `-g` flag do when running `npm install`? 

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How would we create our own `package.json` files? How did `npm` know to install `inquirer` when we ran `npm i` in the `/package/` folder?
